/**
 * A class that supports an asynchronous link between two clock domains. Forge
 * prevents user code from sharing global data such as Object field variables
 * across clock domains. To allow communication between clock domains, an
 * <code>IPCore</code> must be used. This class implements an internal
 * <code>IPCore</code> which contains a 511 deep, programmable width,
 * asynchronous FIFO that supports transferring data from one clock domain to
 * another. Once constructed, the user of this class can use the convenience
 * methods to read and write data from the pipe. Care should be taken to access
 * the correct methods for the side you are on, namely read methods and empty
 * status from the read side, and write methods and full status from the write
 * side. Forge will detect if two clock domains access the same port on the
 * internal <code>IPCore</code> but cannot detect if only one clock domain
 * access is made to a port on the internal <code>IPCore</code> that is
 * referenced to the other clock domain (i.e. a read performed from the write
 * clock domain). The hardware generated by this class to implement the pipe
 * FIFO is optimized for asynchronous situations and will not produce on optimal
 * hardware solution if the supplied clocks are fully synchronous, although the
 * hardware will function correctly for the same clock case. This class supports
 * all Xilinx FPGA families that implement block ram and relies on the
 * <code>net.sf.openforge.forge.api.runtime.RunTime</code> class to determine
 * how to generate the FIFO memory, therefore Forge should be run with the
 * <code>-xlpart</code> command line option set to the correct FPGA family.
